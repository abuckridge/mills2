The region we now call New Mexico has an ancient agricultural history dating back more than a millennium to Puebloan cultures that subsisted on the “Three Sisters”: corn, beans, and squash. The arrival of the Spanish here in the late 16th century, brought flour (among other things) and the Hispano grist mill—a horizontal, counter-clockwise rotating stone mill that became an integral part of hundreds of Spanish settlements across the region over the next several centuries. Nineteenth century westward expansion brought frontiersmen, the American Civil War, and Indian reservations to New Mexico. And everyone had to eat. Flour production skyrocketed, and mills sprouted up like weeds along the riverbeds of the Rio Grande, the Pecos, and their tributaries. Today only a handful of those hundreds of mills remain. 

What was it like during New Mexico’s golden age of grain? In a state now famous for its green chile and blue corn, how did wheat become king for so long? What regions were most affected and why? Who owned these grist mills, and how did they function? How did the history of milling affect the built landscape—the development of towns, forts, and reservations? How did it affect the natural landscape? To what extent did cultivating grain change land and water use throughout the region? And what can we learn about the history of milling in New Mexico that could inform current discussions around localism, sustainability, food deserts, and regional food systems? 

This site is the result of four months of independent undergraduate research in the History Department at the University of New Mexico. This research topic presented itself as the intersection of my interests in regionalism, architecture history, geography, and food studies. The digital format for this project was inspired by a desire to develop my skills in digital history and geomatics. But more than that, I wanted to create a digital interface supportive of public history—my research, my code, and my spatial analysis are now part of a community repository. I invite you to share it, critique it, and expand upon it.
