<h1 id="st-vrains-mill">St. Vrain’s Mill</h1>
<p>Created in or around 1864, St. Vrain’s Mill  located in Mora, New Mexico, was used to fill the high-demand for flour by the US government during the tail-end of the Civil-War and to feed thousands of Navajo Indians during a period where Navajo Indians were held in Fort Union. Many revolts in Taos, NM, saw a number of the mills owned by Ceran St. Vrain burned to the ground. This mill, though rushed and crudely made, served a valuable function to not only the area but to other useful areas as well, such as military forts and holding encampments.  The mill is currently standing in Mora, NM, and is maintained by the ‘<a href="https://www.stvrainmill.org/">St. Vrain’s Mill Preservation and Historical Society</a>’, also located in Mora, NM. The Mill is located at approximately 1500 feet north of the junction state roads 3 and 30 in Mora, NM. <sup id="fnref:formpg1"><a href="#fn:formpg1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="the-mills-purpose">The Mill’s Purpose</h2>
<p>The mill’s overall main purpose was to replace mills that were destroyed in Taos, NM. The United States government had reached out to St. Vrain to be the primary supplier of flour to the military installations around the area, the neighboring regions, and the Navajo Indians which were currently being held at Fort Union, in present-day Mora, NM. <sup id="fnref:formpg1:1"><a href="#fn:formpg1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="st-vrains-fire-resistant-stone-mill">St. Vrain’s Fire Resistant Stone Mill</h2>
<p>The mill was created in a rush to meet high-demand and to replace mills that were lost in Taos durning the “Taos Revolts”. The mill’s construction had one goal and that goal was to fireproof the mill, which was accomplished by crudely making the mill out of stone blocks and different adhesives such as what was around: dirt, rocks, etc. combined with water. Each of the stone blocks used was of varying size, which was not standard to do in this time.  The mill from the ground to top of the roof is 43 feet high and had a total of three floors. The water-wheel which is no longer attached to the building was also rushed and crude in the making for the time. The mill is currently still standing and the equipment still mostly intact; and so deemed crude in manufacturing, it seemed to have served its purpose. <sup id="fnref:formpg1:2"><a href="#fn:formpg1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="closing-of-the-mill">Closing of the Mill</h2>
<p>Ceran St. Vrain held on to the mill until his death in 1870, which was passed and then owned by his son, Vincente, until his death in 1877, passing on to Vicente’s wife, Amelia. Amelia traded her newly acquired mill to her brother William Rohman, who then sold it Franky Gambly until his death in 1922. St. Vrain’s Mill has remained closed ever since. <sup id="fnref:formpg1:3"><a href="#fn:formpg1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="current-state-of-the-mill">Current State of the Mill</h2>
<p>Due to the lack of upkeep in the past, the mill was in a state of decay until the local Mill Preservation and Historical Society took charge to preserve this historical landmark. Whole areas are in need of repair, which is laid out in the letter to Mr. Ken Earl from R. Gordon McKeen, P.E. of McKeen Consulting Engineers, LLC. The mill’s windows currently are boarded shut, and graffiti removed. The wood frame, structurally, is in relatively good condition. The east-wall is in need of stabilization due to wall rotation, which has led to stone and wood damage. <sup id="fnref:McKeenpg1"><a href="#fn:McKeenpg1" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="ceran-st-vrain">Ceran St. Vrain</h2>
<p>Ceran St. Vrain was born on May 5, 1802, to aristocratic parents who fled the French Revolution to French Territory in St. Louis, Missouri. He ventured to New Mexico in 1825 at the age 23 and in his young adulthood, he made his living selling fur. In 1834 he with the help of <a href="http://newmexicohistory.org/people/charles-bent-bio">Charles Bent</a> and <a href="https://www.coloradovirtuallibrary.org/digital-colorado/colorado-histories/beginnings/william-bent-frontiersman/">William Bent</a>, the three of them helped establish ‘Brent’s Fort’ on the Arkansas River. His firm also created the St. Vrain’s trading post on the Platte River. In 1847, St. Vrain was given 4,000,000 acres of land in Southern Colorado. The land grant was granted to St. Vrain after revolts in Taos caused the death of his friend and Governor, Charles Bent. In 1847. St. Vrain led a militia (mostly) to crush the revolts in <a href="http://dev.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=515">Taos</a>, perpetrated by rebels made up of mostly Mexican and Pueblo Indians. In 1855 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel to break marauding bands of Utes and Apaches. During the civil war, he was promoted to Colonel but only kept the rank for a short amount of time before he retired and passed the status on to another. St. Vrain seemed to be a jack of all trades and even dabbled in local politics, but after being defeated in his first and only run, he soon retired from politics. He retired shortly after and went to go live with his son, until Ceran died on October 28, 1870. <sup id="fnref:formpg3"><a href="#fn:formpg3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Though not primary importance to the Sante Fe Trail overall, the influence the mill did have was that of a secondary nature and to provide flour to the nearby installations and people.</p>
