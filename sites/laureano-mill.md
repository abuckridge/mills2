Acorsino Cordova built this Hispano-style grist mill in 1870 in the town of Vadito, in Taos county. Records show that the mill stones were found and carved near Dixon, New Mexico, and they served the mill for over one hundred years. The mill is noteworthy for its quintessential Spanish design: rectangular log construction, flat roof, and a horizontal counter-clockwise rotating mill stone. Cordova’s mill was powered by water from an acequia running along the nearby Rio Pueblo. Laureano Cordova, Acorsino’s son, was still milling commercially by the time of the mill’s nomination to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, making it the last commercially operational Hispano mill in the state.
